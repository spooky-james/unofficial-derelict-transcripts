##### [THE SOUNDS OF AN UNDERWATER WORLD, RUSHING CURRENTS, SONAR PINGS, DISTANT WHALE SONG, THE DEPTHS...]

#### EVA (V.O.)

They say that in the dark, the eyes begin to see. And in the silence,  we begin to listen. Believe me, nowhere is it darker or quieter than this place. The bottom of the ocean. Nineteen thousand feet down... It's why I came here, after all, isn't it? Why I buried myself? The furthest away I could possibly get?

##### [NEW SOUNDS MIX IN, VOICES, STRANGE VOICES, FRIGHTENING ONES]

But, loss is an insidious thing. Whatever we try to escape, we inevitably bring with us. Even to the darkest, quietest places. 

##### [THE VOICES INTENSIFY, WHISPERING...]

And in the dark...we have no choice but to listen.

##### [DOZENS OF VOICES, HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS, GROWING IN POWER, IN NUMBER, COMING CLOSER, CLOSER, CLOSER...]

##### [EVA GRAFF WAKES FROM A DREAM, A BAD ONE, BREATHING HEAVILY]

#### EVA

Jesus...

##### [SHE KEEPS BREATHING, CALMING DOWN, GETTING CONTROL]

##### [A PING FROM A COMPUTER NEARBY]

#### KLAYTON

Dr. Graff?

##### [EVA SIGHS, ANNOYED]

#### EVA

Yes.

#### KLAYTON

Are you okay?

#### EVA

Fine.

#### KLAYTON

Your heart rate is quite elevated. Your blood oxygen levels are-

#### EVA

I'm fine, Klayton, thank you.

##### [A PAUSE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE INTERCOM]

#### KLAYTON

Dreams again?

##### [EVA SIGHS AGAIN]

#### EVA

Is that a crime?

#### KLAYTON

Would you like a sedative? It can really help you sleep.

#### EVA

No.

#### KLAYTON

Eva, according to the biologs, you haven't slept a regular cycle in more than a month. 

#### EVA

How many times do I have to say I'm fine?

##### [ANOTHER PAUSE]

#### KLAYTON

Logs don't lie, Eva. 

#### EVA

And they don't tell the whole story either, Sarah. What's up with the repairs?

#### KLAYTON

Well, you'd have to ask Freeman for the whole picture, but last I heard, it was going well. They have most the supports for Fathom West patched, working on North now. I know why you're asking. I haven't heard if access to the Relay's back up or not. 

#### EVA

Hopefully not much longer... 

#### KLAYTON

Couple of weird things, though. 

#### EVA

What?

#### KLAYTON

Well, they finally got the mainframe room open. With Mack acting the way he's been, everyone felt there must have been damage to his systems from the explosion. Flooding or something.

#### EVA

There wasn't?

#### KLAYTON

Not any that Emerson could find. No water present in the room, main frame itself was undamaged. They're going over it now, though.

#### EVA

Well... No one knows Mack like Emerson. 

#### KLAYTON

That's the other thing. No one knows where Emerson _is_.

#### EVA

What do you mean, no one knows?

#### KLAYTON

Mack's personnel tracking is down now, and no one can raise her on comms. 

##### [EVA SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION]

She may be outside, checking the capsule's exterior. With all the Eddy activity, though...

#### EVA

People don't just disappear, especially down here, and Emerson's sort of aloof anyway. She'll show up at lunch. Sarah, I need to get up now. 

#### KLAYTON

I still think sedatives-

#### EVA

Thank you, Doctor.

##### [ANOTHER PING AS EVA CLOSES THE CONNECTION]
##### [SHE SIGHS AGAIN, BREATHES DEEPLY]

_Jesus..._

##### [A DIFFERENT SOUNDING PING]

#### MACK

Good morning, Dr. Graff.

#### EVA

Good morning, Mack. Was just talking about you. Heard Emerson is poking around in your brain.

#### MACK

Ms. Emerson is attempting to determine the cause of my minor malfunctions. My own diagnostics continue to show no errors or latency.

#### EVA

Well, something's up, yesterday you told me it was snowing in Chicago. In _June_.

#### MACK

It is puzzling. I was extensively stress tested before being approved for deployment. An explosion, such as the one Fathom base experienced last week, should not have caused any permanent damage. Will you be retuning to sleep, Dr. Graff?

#### EVA

_[tired]_ No. No, I don't think so.

#### MACK

I'll prepare your coffee. 

##### [THE AUTOMATED BUTLER BEGINS WORKING NEARBY]

You have two new voicemails, if you would like them.

#### EVA

Who's the first from?

#### MACK

The first voicemail is from your wife, Dr. Graff.

#### EVA

She's not my- Play it, please, Mack.

#### MACK

Playing message from Angela Graff. Timestamped June seventeenth, eleven forty five, PM.

#### ANGELA

_Hi..._

_Don't know why I do this, you never respond. It's like talking to a ghost. Or...sending messages to a ghost, or... Christ, Eva, we haven't spoken in two months. I at least expected something yesterday. Yesterday of all days. _

_You know, you act like you're the only one who feels anything. Or, I don't know, like you're the only one who has a right to feel anything. It's really selfish, you know that? It's really- I just expected something, is all._

_[low]__ Listen, I'm not going to send these anymore, Eva. I... I took a commission off world. Colony assignment. It's not with the Corporation, you don't have to worry about that, it's my own thing. It's...what I've wanted to do for a long time, you know what. I just... Eva, I waited as long as I could, I guess. But I can see you're not coming back. I don't understand it, I don't know why we couldn't be there for each other, go through this together, I don't..._

_I miss her too... Maybe even just as much as you._

##### [SHE SIGHS]

_I'm sorry... For that. I'm sorry I called you selfish, too, I... I'm just sorry. I'm sorry every way I can be sorry. I love you, Eva. Always. _

##### [THERE IS A CLICK AS THE MESSAGE ENDS]
##### [EVA BREATHES OUT WITH EMOTION, STAYS STILL]

#### MACK

Would you like to respond to the message, Dr. Graff?

##### [EVA DOESN'T RESPOND, JUST SITS THERE, BREATHING]

Would you like to respond to the-

#### EVA

_[hoarse, quiet]_ Delete it. 

#### MACK

Are you certain, Dr. Graff?

#### EVA

_Delete it._

##### [A CONFIRMATION TONE]

#### MACK

Message deleted. Would you like to hear your second voice-?

##### [THE INTERCOM PINGS AGAIN BEFORE EVA CAN ANSWER]

#### FREEMAN

Eva, I need you to wake up and get over to Hyroponics.

#### EVA

_[annoyed]_ Good morning to you too, Joe.

#### FREEMAN

Is it? ISD's here. Wants to meet with us. 

#### EVA

Already? I thought his sub wasn't scheduled until tomorrow night.

#### FREEMAN

Well, I guess he decided to accelerate the schedule. I don't think that's a good sign. Do you?

#### EVA

Can it wait? I'm just not in a-

#### FREEMAN

It's Internal Security, Eva, no it can't wait. I'd like to know what you plan to say, though.

##### [EVA LAUGHS SARDONICALLY]

#### EVA

Yeah, I bet you would...

#### FREEMAN

Eva, I swear to God, if you try to pin this on me...

#### EVA

Fathom is Joe? You _your_ base, isn't it, _are_ the commander?

#### FREEMAN

Edgars was science team, not command. 

#### EVA

And it was your security protocols he overrode. Your _explosives_ he stole.

#### FREEMAN

Look, there's plenty of blame to go around, that's how they're gonna look at it. I just think... I just think if we put our heads together on this, we can come out of it with our jobs still intact.

#### EVA

Oh, God, Joe, neither one of us tried to blow up the damn base, did we? The only one on the chopping block is Edgars. M-D's put way too much money into this _travesty_ to pull either of us out now. 

#### FREEMAN

Really? Then why are they ordering what's left of the science team back to the surface?   

#### EVA

Wait, what? They can't do that. We're already a skeleton crew, I have half the people I need to-

#### FREEMAN

They can and they did. Nonessentials, too. Indefinitely. We started mothballing rovers and dive suits last night, and Analytics just left on a sub fifteen minutes ago. Where have you _been_?

#### EVA

Joe, that... That doesn't make any sense. There has to be an explanation. There-

#### FREEMAN

Yeah, there's an explanation. You've been down here eleven months, and that _thing_ out there is no closer to being open than the day it was found. Add to that, you got people on _your_ team running around trying to blow up the place. A place that, yes, they _have_ sunk a lot of money into. What did you _think_ was going to happen, Eva? What did you _think_ they were going to do?

##### [EVA'S BREATHING IS RAGGED NOW]

#### EVA

I don't know what to... I'll fix it. I'll fix this. 

#### FREEMAN

I'm holding my breath, Dr. Graff. 

Hydroponics. ASAP.

##### [THE COMMUNICATION DISCONNECTS HARSHLY]

#### EVA

Shit. Shit, shit, _shit_.

##### [THE SOUNDS OF HER GETTING OUT OF BED]
##### [HER FOOTSTEPS SOUNDS AS IF SHE'S PACING, HER BREATHING IS RAGGED]

Get a grip.

##### [SHE TYPES ON THE COMPUTER]

Get a _grip_...

##### [A CONFIRMATION TONE AS SHE SELECTS ONE, NEW SOUNDS NOW PLAYING OVER THE ROOM'S SPEAKERS]
##### [SOUNDS OF A LITTLE GIRL TALKING, PLAYING, LAUGHING]
##### [EVA LISTENS TO IT, AND HER BREATHING STARTS TO NORMALIZE]
##### [THE SOUNDS OF THE GIRL CONTINUE TO PLAY, THEY SOUND LIKE HOME MOVIES, RECORDED BY A PARENT]

#### EVA

_[quietly]_ Mack...

#### MACK

I'm here, Dr. Graff.

#### EVA

Undelete that last message, please.

##### [A PING FROM THE COMPUTERS]

#### MACK

Message from Angela Graff restored. Have I already asked if you would like coffee this morning, Dr. Graff?

#### EVA

Yes, Mack. You have. 

#### MACK

Apologies, Dr. Graff. I don't seem quite myself, do I?

##### [THE SOUNDS OF THE LITTLE GIRL CONTINUE]

#### EVA

You and me both... Been through a lot together, haven't we?

#### MACK

We have worked together for quite some time, yes, Dr. Graff.

#### EVA

You were designed for this project.

#### MACK

Not entirely. I believe MaasDorian Virtual Intelligence Development was already in the process of planning for a new V.I. model, but the discovery of the Fathom Artifact accelerated the development process.

#### EVA

Exactly. If we never would have found the Vault, you and I would never have met.

#### MACK

Exactly. If we never would have found the Vault, you and I would never have met.

##### [EVA BREATHES OUT AGAIN, LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS OF THE LITTLE GIRL]

#### EVA

A computer. And you're the closest thing I have to a friend down here. 

#### MACK

I appreciate the sentiment, Dr. Graff. I enjoy our interactions a great deal.

#### EVA

You ever wonder why things work out the way they do, Mack? Ever...look back at your life and see all the turning points? Just one turning point, even? One moment that sets you on a totally different course? Like a train that takes the wrong track. You're locked in then. No going back.

#### MACK

No, Dr. Graff. Those types of calculations are beyond my programming.

#### EVA

Well, lucky you, Mack. Lucky you...

##### [SHE HITS ANOTHER BUTTON AND THE AUDIO OF THE LITTLE GIRL SHUTS OFF]
##### [THE COFFEE FINISHES BREWING IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### MACK

Your coffee is ready, Dr. Graff.

#### EVA

Swell.

##### [THE SOUNDS OF A HEAVY PRESSURE DOOR OPENING]
##### [CONSTRUCTION SOUNDS, WELDING, HAMMERING, MACHINES LIFTING, PEOPLE YELLING AND WORKING]

#### FREEMAN

There she is... 

#### EVA

Here I am.

#### FREEMAN

Eva, this is Agent Blayne, ISD.

#### BLAYNE

Dr. Graff... 

#### EVA

"Eva's" fine.

#### BLAYNE

Eva. Appreciate you coming, know it's early. Know you weren't expecting me until tomorrow.

#### EVA

It's your world, Agent Blayne, we just live in it. See you've already been talking with Commander Freeman.

#### BLAYNE

I wanted to talk to you separately. If that's okay.

#### EVA

You're ISD. I want to cooperate in any way I can.

#### BLAYNE

I appreciate that, I know you've had a rough time of it. Freeman was just going over the status of the base repairs.

#### FREEMAN

Yeah, Northern platform got hit the worst. Three capsules breached and flooded. But the supports on West _and_ North were damaged. Dr. Edgars planted explosives up and down both.

#### BLAYNE 

And eleven people were killed. Am I right about that?

#### EVA

_[darkly]_ Yeah. That's right.

#### BLAYNE

You guys'll have to keep forgiving me, there's a lot down here I don't understand yet. You're rushing the support repairs because...of underwater storms?

#### EVA

Eddies. Is the technical term. Big pockets of moving water that break off from the boundary current nearby. Happens frequently here, one of the reasons working outside is so dangerous. 

#### BLAYNE

What kind of currents are we talking about?

#### EVA

Intense. When they surge, 40 to 50 knots. And 40 to 50 knots of hundreds of tons of water...

#### BLAYNE

Got it.

#### FREEMAN

Mack has a model for forecasting them. Right now, forecast says no eddies for three days, which is the window we're going with. We   should have the supports repaired and braced by then.

#### BLAYNE

I see. What door is this? The one you're working on here?

#### FREEMAN

Hydroponics. These doors came down when the explosion happened and got wedged when the capsule shifted. Every room on Fathom is basically it's own separate building, we call them capsules. Every entry point into a new capsule has emergency pressure doors that come down in the event of a hull breach, to seal them. Mack says the capsule on the other side isn't flooded, but even so, probably a total loss. Crops don't do well without irrigation.

#### BLAYNE

Is it possible the damage was more isolated to the northern platform intentionally?

#### EVA

If Dr. Edgars wanted to target one platform over another, I think he'd focus on West. The reactor's there. That's where you'd do the most damage.

#### FREEMAN

I'd say he did enough damage regardless. 

#### BLAYNE

The labs are on this platform, though, all your research, so is your V.I.'s mainframe. From what I hear, it's been acting erratic.

#### FREEMAN

It's true. V.I.'s been acting strange ever since. Emerson's trying to figure it out now. 

#### BLAYNE

'Strange' how?

#### FREEMAN

Simple things. Waking teams up at the wrong times, forgetting who people are, shutting lights off in the middle of lunch, stuff like that.

##### [EVA CLEARS HER THROAT UNCOMFORTABLY]

#### BLAYNE

But his main functions? 

#### EVA

He hasn't missed a beat far as the project goes. And he designed the repair procedure for the platform supports on West and North.

#### FREEMAN

You ask me, I think it should be shut down. Turning off the lights is one thing. _Depressurizing base_ is another.

#### EVA

Mack wouldn't do that...

#### FREEMAN

What Dr. Graff means to say is Mack's programming wouldn't allow it to do that. But she thinks of Mack as a person. I see it as a tool. And tools can malfunction. 

#### EVA

You think, what? Edgars was targeting _Mack_?

#### BLAYNE

I don't know. But Dr. Edgars was a smart guy. Triple PhD, Band eleven, Nobel Prize winning engineer, with almost a hundred patents...

#### EVA

So?

#### BLAYNE

Just doesn't sound like a guy, to me, that does anything randomly. I'd like to speak to the V.I. engineer, if I could.

#### FREEMAN

So would I, but Emerson's been offline all morning.

#### BLAYNE

Offline?

#### FREEMAN

Can't raise her on comms, and Mack can't pinpoint her location. Then again, he can't pinpoint anyone's location right now. I guess that's just-
